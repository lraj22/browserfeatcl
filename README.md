# The Browser Feature Checklist

Hello! Welcome to the Browser Feature Checklist. Visit the site at https://lraj22.github.io/browserfeatcl/ to try it out.

The Browser Feature Checklist (shortened to browserfeatcl) is a website that detects your browser's features, like storage capabilities, deprecated functions, and more, to determine which one it is. Try it out on the [public website](https://lraj22.github.io/browserfeatcl/)!

You can also check out the source code in the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/lraj22/browserfeatcl "lraj22/browserfeatcl on GitHub"). Feel free to contribute!
